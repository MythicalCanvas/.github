## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email your findings to security@example.com
3. Include as much information as possible, such as:
    - Description of the vulnerability
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Potential impact
    - Suggested fix (if possible)

## Response Timeline

- We aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment of the report within 7 days
- We will work on a fix based on the severity and complexity of the issue

## Security Update Process

Security updates will be released as part of our regular release cycle or as emergency patches for critical issues.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. Once a security issue is reported, we will work to validate and fix it
2. We will prepare patches for all supported versions
3. After patches are ready, we will coordinate disclosure with the reporter
4. Public disclosure will be made after patches are available

Thank you for helping keep this project safe!
